## Instructions ##

To enter the interactive environment that runs Haskell, we type `ghci` in terminal and hit "ENTER" after we install the haskell language package.

Then, to load the file we want to run `filename.hs`, we run the following command:

```
:load filename
```

Then we can run and test the functions by typing the function name and input arguments.

To leave the environment, we can run the following command line or press "CTRL+D":

```
:quit
```
